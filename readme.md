# Tailwind  implementation
Tailwind is a CSS framework, it can be used via a CDN os using a Node Package.
In this case the app uses npm to install the package and compile the used styles using a purge functionality

## How to compile
As a developer, it will be necessary to compile the styles every time you add or modify classes to the html or the js.

In order to do so, you'll first need to install all the dependencies for the project:

~~~
node npm install
~~~

Once the packages have been installed you should run the command to compile the CSS using:

~~~
node run build
~~~

Once run, you should see compiled the styles on the src>css folder
